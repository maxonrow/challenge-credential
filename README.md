## Credential

## Problem Statement

- Especially during pandemic, it's very hard to ensure the genuineness of everyone's credentials. Credentials verification is lack of transparency not tamper-proof.
- Apart from test results (which could be easily compromised), governments have no way of verifying if a patient has had COVID-19 and is virus-free. What solution can provide tamper-proof while retrievable data only with the right credentials by leveraging Maxonrow's NFT?

## Example Solution

- A methodology or solution to store huge amount of incorruptible records of credentials
- A methodology or solution to transform digital identity into decentralized identity
- A methodology or solution to capture, record & verify special credentials accurately

## Start Up Credential Project

### Step 1 - Start up blockchain localnet

- Start localnet [here](https://github.com/maxonrow/maxathon/tree/master/blockchain-starter-kit)

### Step 2 - Clone project

- Clone project `$ git clone https://github.com/maxonrow/challenge-credential.git`

### Step 3 - Navigate to backend

- Go to directory `cd challenge-credential/backend/services/credential-api`

### Step 4 - Build & run backend

- run `npm i` & subsequently with `npm run dev` & you should see `Service is serving http://localhost:8081`

### Step 5 - Navigate to frontend

- Go to directory `cd challenge-credential/frontend`

### Step 6 - Build & run frontend

- run `npm i` & subsequently with `npm run serve` & you should see `App running at: Local: http://localhost:8082`

### Step 7 - Checkout article

- checkout our [cookbook](https://medium.com/) on how to design & implement NFT.
